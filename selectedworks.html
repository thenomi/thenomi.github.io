<p>Marcela Lucatelli's <i>A Philosopher Ought to Converse Especially with Men in Power</i> is an interactive WebGL theatre piece. I collaborated with <a href="https://www.marcelalucatelli.co/">Marcela</a> (sound, concept) and <a href="https://gianlucaelia.eu/">Gianluca Elia</a> (programming). The piece was showcased at <a href="https://pythiasjournals.zone/">Pythia's Journals</a> and <a href="http://platformgatt.net/event/reykjavik-2020">Platform Gátt Reykjavík (but online due to the global pandemic)</a>.
<br /><br />
I was commissioned to make 3D models and to animate them. The piece is online and can be played in almost any browser now (including mobiles):<a href="https://philosopher.marcelalucatelli.co">https://philosopher.marcelalucatelli.co</a>

<p>I was commissioned to make videos for Jugend Hackt Berlin, an event for young people who learn/use technology for good causes. The video package contained the jingle, intro, and outro. You can see the event details reported on <a href="https://jugendhackt.org/event-rueckblick/berlin-2019/">Jugend Hackt's page</a>.
<br /><br />
I directed, modelled, chreographed, animated, and edited the videos. For the soundtrack, I used RoccoW's <a href="https://roccow.bandcamp.com/track/break-a-leg">Break a Leg</a> as it was the song that's been used by Jugend Hackt for a long time.

<p>I was commissioned to make a video package for the award ceremony at A MAZE. / Berlin 2019 8th Games and Playful Media Festival for the 3rd time. The video package containins an opening jungle (embedded here), intro, outro, title cards for each awards and people on the stage, and other miscellaneous videos/visual effects. I made almost everything pentagonal since the event poster had pentagonal cylinders. 
<br /><br />
I directed, filmed, designed, modelled, animated, and edited those videos. The soundtrack and sound effects were created by <a href="http://silkersoft.bandcamp.com">Silker/Tom Schley</a>. This cool music is a tropical song according to Tom.

<p>In the early 2019, I was commissioned to create a remote VJ tool for <a href="http://deletegamesand.party/">Delete GDC</a>, a party organised and hosted by <a href="https://www.barsk.com.au/">Bar SK</a> (but the party itself was held somewhere near Moscone Center in San Francisco, I think). Since they had 5 DJs, I made a scene for each DJ. I also made the finale scene where the folder gets deleted/explodes. You can hear me sneezing at the beginning–so, you know the sound was recorded on my microphone and the visualiser was responding to the sounds picked up by that microphone. I used Unity to create the interaction but since I'm such a novice in Unity, I got some help by a couple of friends. I'd love to do more interactive projects in the future (as making an interactive installation for the coursework as a student was one of the most memorable things I did in the university.)
<br /><br />
I modelled, animated, did things in Unity, and performed the keyboard smashing in this demonstration video. The audio reactive setup  was made based on the project made by <a href="https://twitter.com/RenaissanceCode">Renaissance Coders</a>. Xanto Nemot and Fausto Fonseca helped me with coding. The soundtrack I used for the demonstration was created by House Fathers/<a href="http://www.jizai.org/">Jizai</a> Style.

<p>I was commissioned to make another video package for the award ceremony at A MAZE. / Berlin 2018 7th Games and Playful Media Festival.

<p>In summer 2017, Thorsten, the festival director of A MAZE. (more about this in other sections) asked me to help him make a keynote for the 10th <a href="http://globalgamejam.org">Global Game Jam</a>. After some meeting, I remembered that I wanted to try an exercise video and suggested him of making a workout keynote. We liked the idea and designed the structure and wrote the key messages. 
<br /><br />
I co-wrote, directed, filmed, designed, modelled, animated, and edited the video. The video was produced by A MAZE. The script was written and performed by Thorsten S Wiedemann. Music was created and performed by <a href="http://sos.gd">Sos Sosowski</a>. The workout was choreographed by Anne Retzlaff.

  <p>My old friend from university <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Radrey/">Radley Silla</a> asked me to make an intro video for his podcast, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/why-come-japan/id1180108955?mt=2">WHY COME JAPAN</a>. I suggested him about using images of cliché Japan. I also jokingly told him about J. Arthur Rank's gongman to go with the exising soundclip by Isaac "Akasan" Lew. As a result, this short intro clip has both things, a gongman and cliché Japanese images.
</a>
<br /><br />
I made the video. The audio is performed by  Isaac "Akasan" Lew.

<p>I was commissioned to make a package of videos to play at <a href="http://2017.amaze-berlin.de">A MAZE. / Berlin 2017 6th International Games and Playful Media Festival</a>. The package contains jingles, moving panels for the speakers and performer(s) at the stage, award titles for each award, most of the shortened version trailers of nominated games, and other miscellaneous videos (welcome, good-bye, special effects). 
<br /><br />
I secretly (as my client gave me the full control over the project) made the concept, directed, designed, modelled, animated, and edited the videos. Music and sound design were created and performed by <a href="https://c418.org">Daniel Rosenfeld</a>.

<p>I made short count down videos for A MAZE. to notify the last-minute candidates that the deadline for A MAZE. award games submission date is approaching. 
<br />
The festival director came up with the promotion idea and commissioned me this first time in 2016 six days before the deadline. I employed the format of old Vine (6 seconds) in 2016. Then I used Twitter format (30 seconds) in 2017.
<br /><br />
I directed, designed, animated, edited these videos and audio.

  <p>I was commissioned to make a jingle video for a bi-monthly local game event in Berlin, <a href="http://berlingamescene.com/talkandplay/">Talk & Play</a> featuring photos by Julian Dasgupta and a theme song by Alfred Ladylike. If you go to Talk & Play (follow BerlinGameScene.com on meetup.com), you might stil get to see it on big screens!  
</a>
<br /><br />
I made the video using photos by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/12601747@N00/">Julian Dasgupta</a> and music by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alfredladylike/">Alfred Ladylike</a>.

<p>Inspired by Inktober, I challenged myself to make micro videos under 7 seconds everyday in December 2016. A few months after I decided to make a compilation of selected videos from that challenge and some new micro videos that I made. Thus, The Under 7 Seconds Challenge was born.    
<br />
This short film has been screened at <a href="http://brandnewblinkers.tumblr.com">Brand New Blinkers</a> and <a href="http://frontale.at/en/">International FRONTALE Film Festival</a> in 2016, and at Calabria 66 in Barcelona as a part of Cinema66 screening series <a href="https://expcinema.org/site/en/events/brand-new-blinkers-non-verbal-communication">Non-Verbal Communication</a>

<p><i>Poke (Them All!)</i> is a game prototype that I realised with 3 programmers (Xantomen Nemot, Maurits Laanbroek, Paul Quin) and a musician (<a href="http://cedric-douhaire.com">Cedric Douhaire</a>) at Global Game Jam Berlin in 2015. The videos in the link above shows how the game screen would look like. Samuel Haskell voiced one of the videos remotely in the UK. 
<br />
The game uses handmade poking stick controllers and android camera caption system that recognises the contrast of images that the camera sees. With the controllers being recognised, players could 'poke' sprites inside of the game. We had an interview with <a href="http://berlingamescene.com/global-game-jam-berlin-2015-highlights-and-interviews/">BerlinGameScene.com</a>.
<br /><br />
I took a part in conceptualising the gameplay. I was responsible for the artworks and made the videos in the link after the jam since it requires a special setting to showcase the game. I picked this project for this page because I like the nature of the project and this is something I would love to do again.

<p>A short animated film I made as my graduation project. 
<br />
This film was my first film where I wrote the story from scratch and animated using the Animation Department facilities and recorded in the Radio Department in my university. (I did not study in those departments. So, everything was new to me). 
<br /><br />
I directed, wrote, designed, drew, downloaded public domain images, animated and edited this film with a great support by Sylvie Bringas. The lead character (who is not David) was voiced by Samuel Haskell; <a href="http://davyjones-photography.co.uk">Davy Jones</a> was my co-script writer; Marco Tacchino did some sound design; my father <a href="http://www.jizai.org">Yuji Nomi</a> gave me some short sound clips and permission to use his song.

<p>A parasitic egg-n-chill (and maybe videogames) event we started in Antwerp in February 2017.
<br />
The event started as a joke among friends. But somehow it expanded and we are now planning to do more. We are <a href="http://lostlevels.net">Lost Levels @GDC</a> wannabes and want to conduct unconference. We are building a website for the event. A webpage for one of the past events can be seen <a href="https://preeps.itch.io/scrambleshake">here</a>. The popular hashtags are <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/scrambleshake?src=hash">#scrambleshake</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scrambleshake17&src=typd">#scrambleshake17</a>
<br /><br />
Thanks to Talk and Play (a recurring local game event in Berlin), <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BerlinGameScene/events/244718881/">I had a chance to give a short talk (?) </a> about this project/event of ours. (<a href="https://flic.kr/p/21ciJMJ">this</a> is my favourite photo from the event). I do not know if there is any demand, but I would be happy to do the presentation whilst I am young enough to utilise my energy and stupidity.
