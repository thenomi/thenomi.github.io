<ul>
<li><strong>Q: <em>It's a nice weather. Don't you think?</em></strong>
<br />A: I don't know. <br />Please be more specific about why you think it's a nice weather. <br />Then I can continue this weather talk with you. FOREVER. <br /><br/>   </li>
<li><strong><em>Q: You are so flexible. Do you do yoga?</em></strong>
<br />A: No, I've never attended yoga class; <br />I don't have much knowledge about yoga either.<br />My second position is slightly ridiculous because I tend to turn my toes outwards a little too much.<br /><br /></li>   
<li><strong><em>Q: Would you like to work for me? What's your rate?</em></strong>
<br />A: Let's talk. <br /> Talking makes things easier sometimes. <br />Feel free to drop me a line at <strong>the_nomi [at] jizai [dot] org</strong>. <br /><br/>  </li>  
<li><strong><em>Q: Do you want to collaborate with me?</em></strong>
<br />A: Tell me more details. <br />Be warned, though. I might be interested but I really need to earn for living right now. <br />So, I may not be able to take it depending on my situation. <br /><br/>  </li>     
<li><strong><em>Q: Do you sell your artworks as prints?</em></strong>
<br />A: I usually don't. <br />But I would make artworks for prints and I would sell prints from existing artworks on demand. <br />Also, I actually have something like this: <br /><a class="em" href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/the-nomi/works/27127957-ascii-keyboard-gamecube-controller?asc=u&ref=recent-owner">ASCII keyboard GameCube Controller on Redbubble</a> <br /><br/>  </li>
<li><strong><em>Q: What have you been up to?</em></strong>
<br />A: Hm, good question. <br/> I always forget what I've been up to. <br />I had been making new portfolio site every year. Maybe these links help?
