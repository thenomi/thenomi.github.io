<ul>
<li><strong><em>Q: Hi, what's your name again?</em></strong>
<br/>A: Nomi with one O. It sounds like 'know me' or Klaus Nomi.<br /><br />  </li>
<li><strong><em>Q: What do you do?</em></strong>
<br />A: Art? I think??????<br />Like, 2D & 3D & videos (animated & edited)? I also used to be a photographer/videographer.<br />What I actually wanna say is that I do silly things but yeahhhh, I'm working on that.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong><em>Q: What are you currently working on?</em></strong>
<br />A: A couple of paid work and more paid work hopefully!<br />I've been making a secret interactive/game project with my friend Horatiu Roman and we need to get funded for that so that we can continue working on it but we'll see.<br />I also have a short film project and a bunch of video-based projects I've been trying to work on with Scott Polhemus for years–alas, I usually don't have enough funds/time to finish them.<br />But I started planning another interactive project cos... <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong><em>Q: Are you in the games industry?</em></strong>
<br />A: Good question. I don't know tbh but maybe?<br />I've been working for games adjacent projects such as A MAZE., BerlinGameScene.com and I've also started my own community for art & experimemtal games & d0peshit called Gæmz. <br />I've also done some work for games including Hidden Folks, Lingotopia, Don't Trip!, and Fruitbus and made many game jam games but I think I'm still figuring out if I'm in the industry?<br />(I've actually worked on videogames stuff as a crappy webdev before, though. So I might actually be secretly an industry veteran with less experience.)<br /><br /></li> 
<li><strong><em>Q: What's your time zone?</em></strong>
<br />A: Most of my work is in CET/CEST/GMT/BST but physically I'm either in those timezones or in JST as of now (2024).<br />Please help me relocate back to the Euro time zone for my helth.<br /><br/></li>  
<li><strong><em>Q: What kind of music do you listen to?</em></strong>
<br />A: I'd say my musical taste is quite eclectic.<br />I can't play shit but I grew up in a very musical environment and I'm kind of a music nerd who likes to spend hours reading about/listeing to music & musical instruments.<br />Check out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0onM7DXiW1vN23Cn1RBKcs?si=2445d8d850ec4bdd">my random bangers 2023 Playlist</a> I made when I got interviewed.<br /><br/></li>
<li><strong><em>Q: Are you available for work?</em></strong>
<br />A: YES <br /><br/></li>
<li><strong><em>Q: Dude, we are in the same town. Let's hang sometime?</em></strong>
  <br />A: Sure, sounds good.<br /><br /></li>
