<ul>
<li>Q: <em>Hi, what's your name again?</em>
<br/>A: Nomi with one O. It sounds like 'know me' or 'noooo me' and not Naomi.</li>
<li>Q: <em>It's a nice weather. Don't you think?</em>
<br />A: I don't know. Please be more specific about why you think it's a nice weather. Then I can continue this weather talk forever with you.    
<li>Q: <em>Would you like to work for me? What's your rate?</em>
<br />A: Let's talk. Talking makes things easier sometimes. Feel free to drop me a line at the_nomi (at) jizai (dot) org.
<li>Q: <em>Do you want to collaborate with me?</em>
<br />A: Tell me more details. Be warned, though. I might be interested but I really need to earn for living right now. So, I may not be able to take it depending on my situation.     
<li>Q: <em>Do you sell your artworks as prints?</em>
<br />A: I usually don't. But I would make artworks for prints and I would sell prints from existing artworks on demand. Also, I actually have something like this: <a class="em" href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/the-nomi/works/27127957-ascii-keyboard-gamecube-controller?asc=u&ref=recent-owner">ASCII keyboard GameCube Controller on Redbubble</a>
<li>Q: <em>What have you been up to?</em>
<br />A: Hm, good question. I always forget what I've been up to. I had been making new portfolio site every year. Maybe these links help?
