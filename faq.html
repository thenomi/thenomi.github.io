<ul>
<li><strong><em>Q: Hi, what's your name again?</em></strong>
<br/>A: Nomi with one O. It sounds like 'know me' or 'noooo me' but not 'Naomi'. <br /><br/>  </li>
<li><strong>Q: <em>It's a nice weather. Don't you think?</em></strong>
<br />A: I don't know. <br />Please be more specific about why you think it's a nice weather. <br />Then I can continue this weather talk with you. FOREVER. <br /><br/>   </li>
<li><strong><em>Q: You are so flexible. Do you do yoga?</em></strong>
<br />A: No, I've never attended yoga class; <br />I don't have much knowledge about yoga either.<br />My second position is slightly ridiculous because I tend to turn my toes outwards a little too much.<br /><br /></li>   
<li><strong><em>Q: Would you like to work for me? What's your rate?</em></strong>
<br />A: Let's talk. <br /> Talking makes things easier sometimes. <br />Feel free to drop me a line at <strong>the_nomi [at] jizai [dot] org</strong>. <br /><br/>  </li>  
<li><strong><em>Q: Do you want to collaborate with me?</em></strong>
<br />A: Tell me more details. <br />Be warned, though. I might be interested but it really depends because I need to support myself financially so that I can buy more toys for my dog.<br /><br/>  </li>     
<li><strong><em>Q: Do you sell your artworks as prints?</em></strong>
<br />A: I usually don't.  <br />But I would make artworks for prints and I would sell prints from existing artworks on demand. <br />Also, I actually have something like this: <br /><a class="em" href="https://teespring.com/en-GB/ascii-gc-controller#pid=2&cid=2122&sid=front">ASCII keyboard GameCube Controller on Teespring</a> <br /><br/>  </li>
<li><strong><em>Q: What have you been up to?</em></strong>
<br />A: Hm, good question. <br/> I always forget what I've been up to. <br />I had been making new portfolio site every year. Maybe these links help?
<br />

</li>
<li><strong><em>Q: Oh, also, you were doing this Vine thing right? What happened to it? Is it all gone?</em></strong>
<br />
A: Well, actually, the links are still alive. Here you go:<br/>
<a class="em" href="https://vine.co/Nomi">Vine (Nomi)</a> // Micro-vlogging | <a class="em" href="https://vine.co/BerlinGamez">Vine(BerlinGamez)</a> // Videogames in Berlin in 6 seconds. <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong><em>Q: Dude, we are in the same town. Let's hang sometime?</em></strong>
  <br />A: Sounds good.<br /><br />  </li>
